# DIY LeetCode SQL50

## Goal

My intention for this project was to try out Claude code by creating SQL practice questions 
like those found in [LeetCode Top SQL50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/). 


## Approach

- All projects files were created from hand-typed prompts. No external tools were used to refine prompts.
- Local Postgres 14 instance used to create test database generated by Claude
- SQL solutions were validated manually using PGAdmin4


### Prompts

1. I want to create a file of practice SQL questions that test for various SQL concepts 
such as joins, subqueries, window functions, aggregations, CTEs, recursion, indexing, JSON fields, etc. 
Create 100 questions (50 easy, 30 medium, and 20 hard) that make use of practical realistic tables like 
Users, Orders, Products, Activity, Posts, Comments, Movies, Ratings, etc.) Also create a separate SQL file that
creates the database, tables, and seed data. Assume we will load this data into a local Postgres 14 instance.

2. Create another markdown file that provides a solution for each of the 100 questions. 
Favor solutions that are simple and provide an explanation for how it works. 
Also create an example of the correct output results.

3. Can you do this for the first 50 questions?

4. Now create a new solutions file for the remaining questions 51-100

5. Update the 'sql_practice_questions.md' file so that each question includes the expected fields that should be returned in the output.

6. In 'sql_practice_questions.md' make sure that each question provides the relevant table names that need to be used to answer the question


## Key Observations

1. Time and cost is amazing. 
- Session duration took about 45 minutes
- Cost about $3 in tokens.

2. Claude's alignment with query intent is very good even with limited instructions. Assistant prompts for clarification if unsure.

3. Generated code consistency across files is exceptional. 
    - The solutions not only work, the expected output is also true to the records that were seeded during DB setup.
